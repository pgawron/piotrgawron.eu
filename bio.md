# Biography

Piotr Gawron received his magister title in computer science from the Silesian
University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland, his doctoral degree in technical
sciences from the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Informatics, Polish
Academy of Sciences, Gliwice, Poland, and his habilitation degree from the
faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics, and Computer Science from the
Silesian University of Technology in 2003, 2008, and 2014, respectively. 

Prof. Piotr Gawron is a computer scientist specialising in quantum computing and
artificial intelligence methods. He has managed five scientific projects in this
field. He has participated in over a dozen research projects in both basic and
industrial research. Professionally associated with institutes of the Polish
Academy of Sciences and AGH.

For eighteen years, he was a member of the Quantum Systems of Informatics Group
at the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Computer Science, Polish Academy of
Sciences, Gliwice. Since his fourth year of studies, he has been involved in
research in quantum computing. Previously, he was involved in research on
quantum games, quantum walks, simulation of noise-laden quantum computers,
quantum programming languages, quantum control, numerical shadows and tensor
networks. He was the leader of the Scientific Computing and Information
Technology research group at the AstroCeNT facility of the Nicolaus Copernicus
Astronomical Centre, where he led research on the application of machine
learning methods to the analysis of signals from gravitational wave and dark
matter detectors. 

He is currently leader of a research team at Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical
Center of the Polish Academy of Sciences which is studying the application of
quantum machine learning to the processing of Earth observation image data, the
application of quantum and classical machine learning techniques to
gravitational waves and dark matter detection. He leads also a team in AGH
Center of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence, where he focuses on quantum
data fusion as part of the ARTIQ project. He is a visiting professor at the
European Space Agency in the Phi-lab@ESRIN laboratory in Italy. He is involved
in popularising science at fantasy conventions. He is co-author of a comic book
on quantum computing entitled. ‘State Revolution — A Fantastic Introduction to
Quantum Computer Science’.
